1. Coffee Cafe & Pizza Cafe<br>
Description: <br>These projects simulate a virtual café where users can order items from a menu. The program calculates the cost based on user input and checks available ingredients/resources before processing orders.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Use of dictionaries to store menu items, costs, and ingredient availability.<br>
Conditional statements to check ingredient sufficiency.<br>
Basic input/output and cost calculation.<br>
2. Password Generator<br>
Description:<br> A program that generates a secure, random password based on user-defined criteria (e.g., length, use of symbols, numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters).<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Use of the random module to generate random characters.<br>
String manipulation for creating diverse and secure passwords.<br>
User input for customizing password preferences.<br>
3. Guess the Number<br>
Description:<br> A game where the user has to guess a random number within a given range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Use of the random module to generate a random number.<br>
Loops and conditional statements to provide feedback and track guesses.<br>
Simple game logic to engage the user.<br>
4. Hangman Word Guess Game<br>
Description:<br> A word-guessing game where the user tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before they run out of attempts.
Key Concepts:<br>
Lists and string manipulation for tracking guessed letters.<br>
Loops to handle multiple guesses and game progression.<br>
Conditional statements to check for correct/incorrect guesses.<br>
5. Silent Auction Bidding<br>
Description:<br> A program to simulate an auction where multiple users can place bids. The program collects bids and announces the highest bidder as the winner.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Dictionaries to store user names and bids.<br>
Loops to handle multiple bids.<br>
Sorting or comparison logic to determine the highest bid.<br>
6. Rock, Paper, Scissors<br>
Description: <br>A Python version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer. The game announces the winner after each round.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Use of the random module for the computer’s choice.<br>
Conditional statements to determine the winner based on game rules.<br>
Basic input/output to interact with the user.<br>
7. Upper-Lower Game Based on Number of Followers<br>
Description: <br>In this game, the user has to guess whether one social media account has more or fewer followers compared to another account.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Conditional logic to compare follower counts.<br>
Lists or dictionaries to store social media accounts and their follower data.<br>
Input/output for user interaction.<br>
8. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption<br>
Description:<br> A program that encrypts or decrypts a message using the Caesar cipher technique, where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
String manipulation and list indexing for shifting characters.<br>
User input to define the shift key and message.<br>
Modulo arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet.<br>
9. Calculator<br>
Description:<br> A simple calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.<br>
Key Concepts:<br>
Functions for each arithmetic operation.<br>
Input/output for receiving user input and displaying results.<br>
