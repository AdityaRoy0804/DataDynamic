1. Coffee Cafe & Pizza Cafe
Description: These projects simulate a virtual café where users can order items from a menu. The program calculates the cost based on user input and checks available ingredients/resources before processing orders.
Key Concepts:
Use of dictionaries to store menu items, costs, and ingredient availability.
Conditional statements to check ingredient sufficiency.
Basic input/output and cost calculation.
2. Password Generator
Description: A program that generates a secure, random password based on user-defined criteria (e.g., length, use of symbols, numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters).
Key Concepts:
Use of the random module to generate random characters.
String manipulation for creating diverse and secure passwords.
User input for customizing password preferences.
3. Guess the Number
Description: A game where the user has to guess a random number within a given range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
Key Concepts:
Use of the random module to generate a random number.
Loops and conditional statements to provide feedback and track guesses.
Simple game logic to engage the user.
4. Hangman Word Guess Game
Description: A word-guessing game where the user tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before they run out of attempts.
Key Concepts:
Lists and string manipulation for tracking guessed letters.
Loops to handle multiple guesses and game progression.
Conditional statements to check for correct/incorrect guesses.
5. Silent Auction Bidding
Description: A program to simulate an auction where multiple users can place bids. The program collects bids and announces the highest bidder as the winner.
Key Concepts:
Dictionaries to store user names and bids.
Loops to handle multiple bids.
Sorting or comparison logic to determine the highest bid.
6. Rock, Paper, Scissors
Description: A Python version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer. The game announces the winner after each round.
Key Concepts:
Use of the random module for the computer’s choice.
Conditional statements to determine the winner based on game rules.
Basic input/output to interact with the user.
7. Upper-Lower Game Based on Number of Followers
Description: In this game, the user has to guess whether one social media account has more or fewer followers compared to another account.
Key Concepts:
Conditional logic to compare follower counts.
Lists or dictionaries to store social media accounts and their follower data.
Input/output for user interaction.
8. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Description: A program that encrypts or decrypts a message using the Caesar cipher technique, where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
Key Concepts:
String manipulation and list indexing for shifting characters.
User input to define the shift key and message.
Modulo arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet.
9. Calculator
Description: A simple calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
Key Concepts:
Functions for each arithmetic operation.
Input/output for receiving user input and displaying results.
